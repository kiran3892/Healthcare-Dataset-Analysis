# Healthcare-Dataset-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare operational, clinical, and financial data using SQL on the Databricks platform.

The goal is to extract actionable business insights that help hospital management, operations teams, and finance departments improve decision-making.

The analysis simulates real-world hospital scenarios, including patient admissions, length of stay, billing analysis, insurance coverage, doctor workload, and disease trends.

# Business Objectives
- Understand patient admission patterns
- Analyze hospital efficiency (Length of Stay)
- Identify high-cost treatments & conditions
- Evaluate doctor performance and workload
- Assess insurance provider impact
- Provide executive-level KPIs for management dashboards
